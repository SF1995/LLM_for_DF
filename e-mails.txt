Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out and providing this important security update. I understand the need for enhanced account protection. However, I'm a bit hesitant about clicking on the link you provided. Given the prevalence of phishing attempts, I want to ensure the legitimacy of this request.

Is there an alternative way to verify my account? Perhaps we can schedule a quick meeting or have someone from the IT department assist me directly?

I appreciate your understanding and assistance.

Best regards,
Alex
